Cincinnati is home to seven Fortune 500 companies and lays claim to one of the most vibrant startup ecosystems in the nation. Real-world learning We believe cooperative education develops the best engineers! On average, students earn a total of $57,000 and work for companies like Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, and NASA. The best part? You have five different co-op positions to learn what interests you in your field. Innovation UC is at the center of innovation and ranked among the top 100 most innovative schools (Reuters). Students participate in cutting-edge research solving real-world problems, led by world-renowned faculty. The co-op program drew me to UC even before stepping on campus. UC offered a way to help me pay for college and would help me find a job after graduating. Being able to gain the experience while still in school was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. Hannah Newman, Computer Engineering '24 Chicago, IL 75% of students receive a job offer from their co-op placement company #1 for co-op among public universities (U.S. News & World Report) $58m collective co-op earnings per year Engineering & Applied Science News 1 Engineering professor honored with distinguished teaching award June 16, 2025 Janet Dong, PhD, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Cincinnati's College of Engineering and Applied Science and director of the UC Center for Robotics Research, was recognized by the university with the Distinguished Teaching Professor Award.
